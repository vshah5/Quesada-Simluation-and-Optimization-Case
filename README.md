# Quesada-Simluation-and-Optimization-Case
This case was created by my team as part of the Art of Modelling final group project. The case utilizes the simulation and optimization methodologies in order to solve the problem of long queue times at a Quesada franchise. The Case Problem pdf describes the problem at Quesada and the Simulation and Optimization pdf is a teaching note formatted sample solution for those trying to solve the problem using simulation and optimization. The excel doc is our solution of the problem.

*Problem:*
In November 2019, Fred Valdez, the store manager of Central London Quesada, was finalizing the operation report he had made to develop a better understanding of the store’s operations. Located in the central London area, Valdez’ Quesada usually experienced high customer demand compared to other franchised stores located in London. A few days ago, Valdez was alarmed to read negative reviews of his franchise, criticizing the queue times. By comparing his store to other Quesadas operating in London, Valdez deduced that his business had higher overall demand, yet had lower revenue and profit margins. Valdez wondered if this was due to low-cost efficiency, or an issue with queue times, and asked Kya Barrow, a professional in operations management, for consultancy advice as to why this was the case. 

*Solution Methodology:*
Simulation and optimization are used to determine the allocation of resources regarding the operational process at Quesada.
